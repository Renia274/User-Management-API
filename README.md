# User Management API

The User Management API is a RESTful web service that provides endpoints for managing user data. It allows users to perform operations such as creating new users, retrieving user information, updating user details, and deleting users.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Maven
- MySQL
- IntelliJ IDEA

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/UserManagementAPI.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd UserManagementAPI

3. Build the application using Maven:

mvn clean install

4. Run the application:

mvn spring-boot:run

The application will start on http://localhost:8080.

## Usage

To use the User Management API, you can send HTTP requests to the provided endpoints using a tool like Postman. The API supports the following HTTP methods:

    GET - Retrieve user information
    POST - Create a new user
    PUT - Update user details
    DELETE - Delete a user

Make sure to include the necessary request headers and JSON payload as specified in the API documentation for each endpoint.

## Endpoints

The User Management API provides the following endpoints:

    POST /login - Authenticates a user and generates an access token
    GET /users - Retrieves a list of all users
    GET /users/{id} - Retrieves information about a specific user
    POST /api/users/insert - Creates a new user
    PUT /users/{id} - Updates details of a specific user
    DELETE /users/{id} - Deletes a specific user

## POST /login

This endpoint is used to authenticate a user and generate an access token. The request should include the user's credentials, such as the username and password, in the JSON payload. Upon successful authentication, the API will respond with an access token that can be used for subsequent authorized requests.

Example request using Postman:

## Postman POST /login

Example response:

{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}

## POST /api/users/insert

This endpoint allows creating a new user. The request should include the user's details in the JSON payload, such as the username, email, and password. The id field is automatically generated by the database and API implementation.

Example request using Postman:

## Postman POST /api/users/insert

Example response:



{
  "id": 123,
  "username": "newuser",
  "email": "newuser@example.com"
}

Please note that the actual request and response formats may differ based on the implementation details of the User Management API.


## Pagination

## GET /api/users: Retrieves users with pagination. Specify the page number and page size as query parameters.

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/users?page=0&size=10"

## Sorting 

## GET /api/users: Sorts users based on specific criteria. Use query parameters to specify the sort field and order.

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/users?sortField=name&sortOrder"

##Filtering 

## GET /api/users: Filters users based on specific criteria. Use query parameters to specify the filter field and value.

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8080/api/users?filterField=name&filterValue=John"

## POST /api/users/insert: Creates a new user.

$body = @{
    name = "John Doe"
    email = "john.doe@example.com"
    password = "password123"
}

## Input Validation

The API includes input validation. If validation fails, appropriate error responses will be returned to the client.

Please ensure that you provide valid data when creating or updating users to avoid validation errors.Also, you need to make a connection to your MySQL database.
